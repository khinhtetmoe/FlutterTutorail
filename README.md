In this lesson, I learnt about using Images Widgets.
We can use Image Widget in two ways.
First way is using image widget and add properties inside image widget.
for example, Image(image:NetWorkImage('xxxxxxx')) or Image(image:AssetImage('Assets/xxx.png'))
Second way is using like this-Image.network('XXX') or Image.asset('Assets/xxx.png')
